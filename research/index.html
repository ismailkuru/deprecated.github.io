				  Concurrent program verification/reasoning is hard.
				  Program logics these programs usually require an expertise.
				  We try to come with simple type assertions which
				<ul>
					<li>abstract,</li>
					<li>simple and,</li>
					<li>reusable for arbitrary clients.</li>
				</ul>
				It is interesting that these type assertions can also enforce properties that heavy-weight program logics
				do such as memory safety.
