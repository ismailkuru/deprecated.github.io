				<h5><strong>Concurrent Low-Level System Code Verification</strong></h5>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				  Concurrent program verification/reasoning is hard.
				  Program logics for concurrent programs usually require expertise.
				  We try to come with simple type assertions which
				<ul>
					<li>abstract,</li>
					<li>simple and,</li>
					<li>reusable for arbitrary clients.</li>
				</ul>
				It is interesting that type assertions usually are capable of asserting properties which are similar to the ones that heavy-weight program logics
				assert, e.g. memory safety.
