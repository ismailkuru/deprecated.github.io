				<h5><strong>A Primer on the Irregular Programs</strong></h5>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Regular programs operate over linear data structures such as dense matrices and arrays. 
				Unlike them, the programs which operate over <b>pointer-based data structures such as trees and graphs</b> are known as irregular programs. 
				Research in the past has led to the creation of catalogs of performance-enhancing transformations for regular programs.
				In contrast, there have been relatively few works targeting irregular programs for enhancing performance.
				Even though work has been done to enhance specific irregular applications, general approaches to improving the performance of broad classes of irregular applications are rare.
				Pointer-based data structures are difficult optimize because they are,
				<ul>
					<li>Input-dependent,</li>
					<li>Highly dynamic and,</li>
					<li>Defined recursively.</li>
				</ul>
				It is unsurprising that generalization of optimizations on irregular programs is a hard problem.
